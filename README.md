# Self learning for Math

This project includes work from my adventure using MOOC course to self-learn math. 
Math is very important for many different disciplines and my passion for coding has
given me a hunger to also strengthen my math skills. I will be using this repo to show 
my work from the various courses I take. The goal is to translate as much math as I can 
into code. Some courses will require coding assignments; other courses will be coded 
simply to gain a deeper understanding of the formulas I have learned. As I complete each
course I will upload my certificate of completion.
